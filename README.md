# Kingdom Expansion Challenge

## üìã Project Overview

The **Kingdom Expansion Challenge** is a C++ implementation of the classic **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** problem using **Prim's Algorithm**. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a kingdom needs to expand by connecting villages with roads at the minimum possible cost.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Imagine you are the royal engineer of a growing kingdom. The king wants to connect all villages in the realm with a road network, but resources are limited. Your task is to:

- Connect all villages with the minimum total construction cost
- Ensure every village is reachable from every other village
- Use the most efficient algorithm to find the optimal solution

This is essentially finding the **Minimum Spanning Tree** of a weighted graph where:
- **Vertices** represent villages
- **Edges** represent possible road connections
- **Weights** represent the cost of building each road

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Graph Class (`graph.h` & `graph.cpp`)
- **Data Structure**: Adjacency matrix representation of the graph
- **Key Methods**:
  - `loadGraphFromFile()`: Reads graph data from input file
  - `primMST()`: Implements Prim's algorithm to find the MST

#### 2. Main Program (`main.cpp`)
- Orchestrates the entire process
- Loads graph data from `input.txt`
- Executes Prim's algorithm
- Displays the resulting minimum spanning tree and total cost

#### 3. Input Format (`input.txt`)
```
5 7           # [Number of vertices] [Number of edges]
1 2 4         # [Start vertex] [End vertex] [Weight/Cost]
1 3 3
2 3 1
...
```

### Algorithm: Prim's MST

**Prim's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that builds the MST by:
1. Starting with an arbitrary vertex (village 1)
2. Repeatedly adding the minimum-weight edge that connects a visited vertex to an unvisited vertex
3. Continuing until all vertices are included in the MST

**Time Complexity**: O(V¬≤) where V is the number of vertices
**Space Complexity**: O(V¬≤) for the adjacency matrix

## üîß Build & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++17 support (g++, clang++)
- CMake (optional)
- Make utility

### Building the Project

#### Option 1: Using Makefile
```bash
make
./kingdom_expansion
```

#### Option 2: Using CMake
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./LastName_FirstNamePrim
```

#### Option 3: Direct Compilation
```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -o kingdom_expansion main.cpp graph.cpp
./kingdom_expansion
```

### Cleaning Build Files
```bash
make clean
```

## üìä Example Output

Given the input graph with 5 villages and 7 possible roads:

```
Number of nodes: 5
Number of edges: 7
Adjacency Matrix:
0 4 3 0 0
4 0 1 2 0
3 1 0 1 7
0 2 1 0 3
0 0 7 3 0

Minimum Spanning Tree:
Connecting village 1 to village 3
Connecting village 3 to village 2
Connecting village 3 to village 4
Connecting village 4 to village 5
Total Cost: 7
```

This means the kingdom can connect all 5 villages with a total road construction cost of 7 units.
